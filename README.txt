My first experience with R, the purpose of this project was to experiment with a text file containing group chat history retrieved from the GroupMe API in HTML format. Initially the information had to be cleaned into a workable format, and was subsequently used to analyze messenger frequency, average message length per user, and to measure activity in the group chat based on the time of day. For privacy reasons the actual chat history is not uploaded, but a snippet showing the format of the text file is provided, as well as a folder containing the visualizations achieved by the program.
